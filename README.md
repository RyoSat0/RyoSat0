### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ryo Sato
I am a Software Engineering student at Concordia University, currently in my third year of study. I began my programming journey with Python, gradually expanding into languages like Java, C/C++, and JavaScript, and over the past two and a half years, I've built a strong foundation in these and other languages. I thrive in challenge-driven environments, which has driven me to participate in hackathons like ConUHacks, where my team developed an interactive 1v1 game using Python and Tkinter.
